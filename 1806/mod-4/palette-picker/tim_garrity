# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/Salamandastron1/palette-picker/blob/ab97fd0949dc5cf41c966daeb49131430a95cad5/public/scripts/scripts.js#L136)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

the for loops are inspired and do a lot of work

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/Salamandastron1/palette-picker/blob/ab97fd0949dc5cf41c966daeb49131430a95cad5/public/scripts/scripts.js#L76)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

vanilla javasscript is a monster. I realized to late that I could have made a data or "state" object in the constructor. That would have allowed me to essentially have the same functionality of react without react :P

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

My README is very thorough. Please reference it for these.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Project was cool. I will probably continue styling and put it up as a example on my resume once that's done.
