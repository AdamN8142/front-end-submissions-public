## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Mostly. I lack the ability to view the colors in a template and have them displayo n the main screen when chosed from the project menu. I struggled pretty hard with writing vanilla JS again after spending so long in react land, but eventually got into the hang of basic dom manipulation by the end of it.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/30ozSteak/Juicy/blob/ee312dbe4d41632ad0fd7a397a6a7bcf61be3a87/public/style.css#L253)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I was proud of my random color generator code, and a few other pieces, but despite not being the spirit of the project, my favorite code snippet was the magic I pulled off to make a unique landing screen. The juicy logo has 5 colors rotating indefinitely behind it, and when clicked displays the palette. I *super* liked it because I had seen a picture of something similar on dribble, said "I can make that", and then I did. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/30ozSteak/Juicy/blob/ee312dbe4d41632ad0fd7a397a6a7bcf61be3a87/public/scripts/scripts.js#L103)


* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?


when I started this project, utilizing class architecture made a lot of sense and felt like I was going to channel some more react, despite it not being a react project. I didn't follow through with this bit and didn't use classes in the rest of the app.


#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

Originally, this was going to be just ideabox colors.

then I found this screenshot on dribble for some... other kind of app..

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I really set out to make something that was a unique departure from everything else on my portfolio, 
and think I nailed it. I'll be working on th rest of the functionality over the next week or so, 
because this is something I'd personally want easy access to for creating color palettes
