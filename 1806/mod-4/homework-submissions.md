  1. Add client-side JavaScript file in the public directory for some interactivity.
  2. Instead of passing the {“name": “Robbie"} JSON object directly into .json() for the localhost:3000/json route. Create some JSON data in a separate file, load that file in the server, and send that file’s JSON data as a response instead of {“name": “Robbie"}.
  3. Add a custom 404 page for when the client makes a request to an undefined endpoint. Hint
