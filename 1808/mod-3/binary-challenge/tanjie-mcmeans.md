  readme contains screenshots of application. Project team uses a rebase
  workflow, taking advantage of github issues to track work. Project shows a
  complete mastery of React architecture.

### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all
  components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async
