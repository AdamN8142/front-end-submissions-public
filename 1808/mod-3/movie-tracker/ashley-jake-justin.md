Am I accounting for errors? Am I being consistent in handling them?
Coverage does not indicate everything is tested at the unit level
Think about security implications of what you're storing - ie. password and ids

## Rubric 

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal
  recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all
  components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async
  functionality.

### Redux Architecture
