### Evaluator: David Whitaker

### Comments:

* Only fetch data when you need it
* Use router instead of state to change component to display so that you can utilize back button
* When testing async - always be sure to name what happens in anonymous callbacks

* Did not use linter
* Used issues
* Needs more commits - should be twice as many
