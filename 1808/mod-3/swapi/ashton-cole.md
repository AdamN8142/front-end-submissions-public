### Comments:

* Always think about how things can be refactored to dedup
* Right now there is a lot of duplication with each resource component - instead of People, Vehicles.... you could have a Carousel component that handles all of those cases
* Always refactor and dedup right away - favePlanets... could be toggleFave
