# Game Time
* Students: Dylan and Shannon
* Evaluator: Robbie

Comments:
* Make spin value larger on the screen, and make the UI a little more compact so you do not have to scroll through the page during game play.
* In the final round, the winner guesses the puzzle, but if they get it wrong the game lets the next contestant make a guess...

### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.


### Workflow

* 4 - The developer/team effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application with descriptive commit messages. The team displays good pairing practices (driver-navigator, dividing up work, etc) and utilizes some sort of planning tool (GitHub issues, Waffle, Trello, etc). The team develops a clear MVP (minimum viable product) and conducts a DTR (define the relationship). Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.
