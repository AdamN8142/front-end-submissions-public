* Major Bugs:
1. Can spin wheel multiple on same turn and player can guess letters without spinning the wheel - 
2. Can guess letters without spinning the wheel
* There are too many words on the main page - cut that back to make directions more digestable.
* Place inputs need together on the main page.
* Great job with tracking issues. 200 commits seems like A LOT for this size of project. Would expect more around 100 or so - be careful not to be too granular.
* Some duplication in game - could dry up code
* Some intermixing of logic between classes (`Puzzle` and `Game`)

### Functional Expectations

* 2 - Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 2 - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Application is organized into classes that do not display a good understanding of encapsulation, and logic is not well-divided. Developer cannot articulate what each line of code is doing. There are one or more major bugs.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.
