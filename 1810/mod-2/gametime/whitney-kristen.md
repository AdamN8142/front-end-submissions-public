# Game Time
* Students: Whitney & Kristen
* Evaluator: Pam

Comments:
* Tweaking of the UX to show when someone gets an answer wrong/right. Nice, pleasant UI.
* Functionality implemented through part of 1st round only, with bugs
* Major Bug:
1. Game does not allow for completely playing through Round 1. Logic does not allow for all tiles to be cleared from the board - making it so that as many as 2 - 8 tiles will not disappear to complete Round 1.
* DTR was implemented but never revisited, causing issues with pairing. Discussed strategies for future pairings/group work

**Initially submitted with lower scores in OOP/JS, functionality, and testing. Updated repo submitted before deadline at 10AM with additional OOP and testing updates only. Scores below reflect updated repo**

### Functional Expectations

* 2 - Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 2 - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Application is organized into classes that do not display a good understanding of encapsulation, and logic is not well-divided. Developer cannot articulate what each line of code is doing. There are one or more major bugs.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.
