# Game Time
* Students: Hillary & Tiffany
* Evaluator: Pam

Comments:
* Increase the time that the messages appear on screen - they move fast and can be hard to read.
* Clean, simple UI - try to highlight the directions a bit more. 
* Appreciate the specific inputs for the bonus round - it is easy for the bonus round to be confusing from a user standpoint if the UX is lacking.
* Good use of issues/labels. 56 commits is somewhat low - would expect more for this particular project

### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate. 

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication. SRP (single responsibility principle) and DRY (donâ€™t repeat yourself) principles are utilized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) and there are no instances where instructor would suggest moving logic or data to another class. The business-logic code driving functionality is cleanly separated from rendering, view-related code.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.
