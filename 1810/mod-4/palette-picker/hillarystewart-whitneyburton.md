#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/whitneyburton/fe-cool-colors/blob/c0af1cb2594ecfe390fe6ccdb2c0ffb7016921c2/src/utils/helper.js#L25)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Since our color generation functionality was single responsibility, we were able to reuse the makeColor function to make our header on each refresh a different color.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/whitneyburton/fe-cool-colors/blob/c0af1cb2594ecfe390fe6ccdb2c0ffb7016921c2/src/containers/Controls/Controls.js#L25)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Its a little hard to determine what all the handleClick function is doing and we feel we could have made functions to call in each part of the if else.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

Hillary shared her idea of our design and after drawing it out on the whiteboard, we both agreed that we liked the layout. 

#### Reflection on New Concepts

* Describe your thoughts on server-side testing
- server side testing IS AWESOME, it's much more straight forward than client side. While we definitely had some pain points it was purely because of our own silly mistakes.

* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI
- TravisCI is great. I was very intimidated by it at first, but getting it started and running wasn't nearly as bad as I assumed it would be.

* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
- Having multiple repo's is tricky at times because of human error like forgetting to pull down the most recent changes from one of the repo's, or forgetting to spin up both the back end and front end separately.
