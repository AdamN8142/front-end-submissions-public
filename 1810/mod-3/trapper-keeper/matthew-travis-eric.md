### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).
