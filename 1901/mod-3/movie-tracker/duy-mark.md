### Evaluator: Leta
### Students: Mark, Duy
### Comments:

This project is failing 3 of 5 rubric areas. Most components that need the most testing are not tested at all. The tests that exist are insufficient. Base functionality of app is incomplete/buggy. PropTypes were not utilized, many linting issues. Commits are atomic, which is good. Actual use/implementation of Redux amd Router seems solid.

See slack for further notes.


## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

Favorites are incomplete

* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing part of one or more of the features outlined above. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 2 - Project is missing PropTypes, README updates, wireframes, or has more than 5 linter errors. Project team makes large infrequent git commits. Project shows a basic understanding of React.

### Testing

* 1 - A valid attempt to test this application was made, but there are obvious gaps, with missing unit tests for Redux and React.

### Redux Architecture

* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
