### Comments:

Missing all or almost all asynchronous testing. Tests are in place for redux. Component snapshot tests are in place, but very few component function tests are written. Nice work on Redux! The redux tests look good. 

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 2 - Nearly all unit tests for Redux and React are in place. No attempt to test async functionality was made.

### Redux Architecture

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
