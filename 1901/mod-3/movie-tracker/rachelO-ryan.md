### Comments:

GREAT work on the spec adherence! Your project had a fun theme and all the features worked without bugs.

Number of commits is 208 - excellent! Commit messages are inconsistent - ideal language is imperative, like commands. Instead of "Testing started for fetchMovies thunk", the message should read like a command: "Start test for fetchMovies thunk". Then, the commits read like a log of instructions.

Containers are missing tests for mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps.

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 4 - All requirements from 3 are met. The application completes all iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions. And the evaluator has no recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async functionality.

### Redux Architecture

* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
