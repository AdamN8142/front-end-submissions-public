## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good work on number of branches and commits
  * Good consistency with branch names
  * Continue to work on consistency with commit messages
* Nice work implementing waffle.io
* Buttons on each card could be centered vertically a little more
  * Buttons in mobile view are a little close
* Make sure to use a form for the inputs and labels rather than a div
  * We could have a form both for the search as well as the area where we create an idea
* Careful of not using inline styles in your html
* Would not recommend gives all ids a number value through all of the buttons for JS reasons
  * Ids are good querying elements, but not storing a value
* Good work keeping the HTML structure clean
* Good organization of styles and alphabetizing properties
* Quite a bit of dom logic is inside of the Idea class
* Good work keeping track of index in class
* Ideas should start out with the localStorage.getItem or an empty array
* Load cards gets a bit complex (could refactor instead of using multiple for loops using splice/slice and grab the last 10)
* Careful of using inline styles in your JavaScript
* Careful of having multiple buttons for show more/less functionality.

### Functional Expectations

*  Exceptional - Application adds all of the extensions

### Comp Recreation

*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by using appropriate semantic elements and using `data-*` attributes for all data related things

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by correctly implementing a data model for the `Idea` class including all required methods
