## Notes/What To Work On:

*General*
* Keep those commit message active
* Cool job doing the co-authored commits
* Can still submit ideas when one of the input fields is empty (no exceptional)
* Filtering by quality is working, along with the show more and show less
* for comp recreation, make the show more / show less an equal width to the rest of the buttons on small screens. Otherwise the comp recreation looks really good
* PUT A LINK TO YOUR LIVE SITE IN THE README

*HTML*

* Mover normalize about the styles input
* Don't put the title inside of a nav tag 
* good job using the data attributes 

*CSS*

* Just two media queries
* General element styles at the top, the organized by the page flow, then media queries
* Don't forget to stack your css selectors if you're applying multiple selectors to a rule


*JS*
* Don't forget to take out the console.logs
* Take out that global variable for ideaCount
  * we talked about how to refactor, could make it a local variable for showMore  and showLess function, but pass a second param into the deleteCard function
* Some functions could be a litle shorter, but the JS is looking well sctructured and organized on the whole
* Good job removing elements from the DOM instead of just hiding / showing
* Becuase of the extra global variable and a few functions being over 10 lines, the JS isn't quite at proficient



### Functional Expectations

*  Proficient - Applications adds 'Filtering by Importance' and 'Recent Ideas' as outlined in the spec


### Comp Recreation -- check about the size of the show more / show less on mobile screens

*  Exceptional - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements that have been added match the visuals established in the comps

### HTML - Style and Implementation


*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions


### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle


### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by correctly implementing a data model for the `Idea` class including all required methods
