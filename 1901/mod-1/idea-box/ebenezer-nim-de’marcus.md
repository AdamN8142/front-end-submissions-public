### HTML - Style and Implementation 

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by using appropriate semantic elements and using `data-*` attributes for all data related things

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting and editing an idea (clicking outside of the text field)
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and an array for your ideas
  *  There are no nested if else statements
