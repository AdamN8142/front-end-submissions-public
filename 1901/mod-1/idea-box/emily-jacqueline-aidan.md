## Notes/What To Work On:

*General*

* PUT A LINK TO YOUR LIVE SITE IN THE README

* Keep commit messages active and specific
* Make sure everyone is getting a good amount of times to have hands on keys
* Used co-authored commits
* Did a lot of CSS remotely, but mostly the JS was done together
* Make sure everyone on the team is getting enough time with their hands on the keyboard

* Got things working up through Show More / Show Less
* Would look cleaner if the show more and show less only appeared when they needed to
  * This could make a more cohesive user experience
* Comp recreation looks really good, things are responsive and shrink down to a non-awkward size
* Good job only using two media queries

*HTML*
* Be careful with your structuring (indentation)
* Some of the elements could be more semantic
  * Think about how to balance the styling with semantic functionalty
* Using data-attributes

*CSS*
* Don't forget to stack selectors
* Add another class to rules that are being over-selected for

*JS*
* Keep all event listeners together on the page
* Using event listeners to
* DRY up the hide/showAllIdeas functions the way we talked about
  * Move conditional logic into one changeIdeas() function



### Functional Expectations

### Comp Recreation

*  Exceptional - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements that have been added match the visuals established in the comps

### HTML - Style and Implementation


*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by using appropriate semantic elements and using `data-*` attributes for all data related things


### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle


### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by correctly implementing a data model for the `Idea` class including all required methods
