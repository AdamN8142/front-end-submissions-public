## Student: Kayla Lawson & Mark Collins
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good work on number of commits and commit messages
* Be consistent with name branches
* Good attention to detail on the UI
* Spacing between buttons could could be evened out a little more
  * Buttons could be a little bigger on bigger screens
* On mobile view, maybe change the buttons into a drop down
* Make sure to be consistent with camel case for class names
* Really clean HTML structure and good work using semantic elements
* A few classes that could be combined together
* Good work remembering box-sizing border box
* Good work and organization and alphabetizing properties for styles
* Nice work grouping styles together and keeping your media queries down
* Still would recommend naming parameters more specific
* Could use bracket notation for updateContent
* Could refactor update quality by keeping track of the index of an array rather than explicitly checking each value
* Good work using event delegation
* Careful of adding multiple event listeners on the same section
* Think about how you can refactor swillIdeas, plausibleIdeas, etc.
  - Same for upvote and downvote functions have some repeated code to the class
* Make sure names are consistent (functions should be a verb)

### Functional Expectations

*  Proficient - Applications adds 'Filtering by Importance' and 'Recent Ideas' as outlined in the spec

### Comp Recreation

*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting and editing an idea (clicking outside of the text field)
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and an array for your ideas
  *  There are no nested if else statements
