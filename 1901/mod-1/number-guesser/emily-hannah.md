## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good start with number of commit messages and branches
* Keep working on making sure commit messages are clear and following rules
    - Such as using imperative tense
* Use kabob case for branch names
    - Make sure branch names are descriptive as well on what feature is being added or bug being fixed
* Some parts of UI don't match the comp
    * Set range should be inline instead of stacked on top of each other
* Same for mobile, some things that don't quite match the comp
    * Buttons need to be bigger and stacked on mobile
    * Same for current guesses
    * In general keep working on paying attention to matching the comp
* Make sure to tab elements in correctly in HTML
* Stay away from inline functions
    * Should be able to use type number for number inputs
* Clean up spaces between elements
* Good organization of styles and alphabetizing properties
* Some places where classes that share similar styles could be grouped together
* I recommend callback function in event listeners to be named functions instead of anonymous functions
* Could refactor displayStatus functions into one and pass the guess1 or guess2 through as an argument
    * A few other instances where this can be done
* A few places where variables are being assigned multiple times in the same line which is likely causing issues.  Should only have one assignment operator
