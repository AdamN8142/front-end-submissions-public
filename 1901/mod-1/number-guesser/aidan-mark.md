## Student: Aidan McKay & Mark Collins
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Great work on the number of commits and descriptive commit messages
    * Continue to work on creating more branches
    * Be consistent with kabob case for branch names
* Avoid alerts for errors (implement them into the UI)
* Make the application fill up the whole page
* Submit guess button should not work if not all of the inputs are filled
* A few bugs with the guesses showing up twice on the screen at the bottom
* Continue to work on adding the card when the user wins the game
    * Card should not be there in the beginning and only appear when user wins game
* A few places where spacing could be organized a bit better
    * Text on button
    * Header could be centered vertically
* Nice work using BEM classes and following those conventions
* A few places where we could use more semantic html
    * header instead of nav
    * Forms for our inputs
* Make sure to include box-sizing border box
* Find places that share similar styles and group them together or use one class name on multiple elements
* Instead of big decimals using ems/rems for paddings, use px for honing in on styles
    - Ems/rems are great for fonts
* Good organization in general, make sure to alphabetize the properties
* I would recommend organizing the javascript so it's global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Shouldn't need to query select elements multiple times in global variables and local variables
* Would add disabled attribute if you want buttons to start off disabled
* Could refactor the error functions like requireNameOne and requireNameTwo into one function and pass arguments and parameters to make it dynamic similar to how you did displayGuess
