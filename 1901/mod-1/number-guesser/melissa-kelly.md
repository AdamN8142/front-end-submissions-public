## Student: Melissa LaChasse, Kelly Zick
## Evaluator: Khalid Williams 
## Notes/What To Work On:

* Keep commit messages in the active tense and capitalized

* UI looks really good
  * Good intuition on what fields to clear out at what time
* Error messages look good
* Range is updating on wins
* Reset button is clearing the cards
    * Some bug happened when refactoring
    * This is holding you back from a proficient in functional expectation, make sure to test your code as you would demo it after refactoring 
* Could use a main for the game container instead of multiple nested
* Don't forget to take the extra h1s out of the bottom of the html
    * This aside, the HTML looks really good
    * MAKE SURE TO FIX THIS 
* Need to alphabetize the properties in CSS

* JS
    * DRY up the `compareGuess` functions via parameters
    * Same thing with `errorMessage` and `reverseErrorMessage`



### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.


------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation


* __Proficient:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
