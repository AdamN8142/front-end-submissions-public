## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work with branch names
    * Make more branches
* Good work on commits, continue to make more commits for small pieces
    * Instead of a commit that handles html, css, and js
* Some things that could be a bit spaced out more evenly in the UI
* A few break points could come in a bit earlier
* Should not need to refresh the page to reset the game.  
* Careful of using so many `li` elements in the HTML (focus on other semantic tags)
* Continue to work on being more semantic with HTML like using forms
* Cut out white space in html
* Also see how you can dry up CSS by grouping classes together that share similar styles
* Good organization, but remember to alphabetizes properties
* See how you can do less micro-managing for responsiveness using ems/rems and less media queries
* Nice work with organization of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Use innerHTML to add each card instead of using display block and display none
* Clean up repetitive variables (if it is globally scoped, you do not need to create a local variable for it as well)
* Nice work using arguments and parameters for your guessCheck function to make it dynamic
* Could refactor your winningCard into one function similar to guessCheck and pass arguments.  
    * Continue to find areas where you might see repeated code

### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts markup according to the [turing html style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/html)

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules and
  * Has 5 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
