## Notes/What To Work On:

Really solid comp implementation
Need to use forms in html!
Love the organizational comments and lack of duplication in the css
Look for duplication in js and pass arguments where applicable

### Functional Expectations

  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements and:
  * Keeps functions DRY with a focus on SRP and can call functions within functions
  * There are no nested if/else statements
*  __Exceptional:__ Functions and code are well-refactored and show developer empathy and:
  * No global variables aside from query selectors, min & max, number of guesses, and start time
  * All functions are less than 10 lines
  * Uses logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable
