## Notes/What To Work On:

* In the future, feel free to re-DTR if you need to
* Make sure to keep git commit messages professional and active 
* Awesome job with the error handling
* Nice job with animations and extensions (Mr Poopy Butthole in the name fields)
    * Work on keeping the card addition animations smoother in the future, the flashing feels a little choppy
* Remove comments in HTML
    * This is holding you back from an exceptional in HTML
* Use ids instead of unique classes for targeting JS
* Good job incorporating SMACSS syntax within the html. In the future, ensure both group members find it to be a helpful and understandable convention to employ  
* Use fewer global variables in the future
* Plenty of places to refactor the JS in here
    * In general, your code should speak for itself. Similar to the HTML, remove any comments inthe code before submitting. A few organizational comments are OK (ex `// Global Varaibles:`, `// Event Listeners:`), but you should not have any commented lines describing your specific functions in this mod.
* Good job using SRP
* Dont forget to alphabetize your CSS properties
    * This helps keep your properties organized within rule. The CSS is in very good shape, this detail aside.
* Keep your CSS organizing comments consistantly layed out (make sure you're consistently putting empty lines between organizational comments and rules)

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation
