## Student: Lauren Boyer & Jacqueline Moore
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Continue to work on GH flow and making more commits and branches
    - Make sure your GH has the latest code!  Otherwise other developers cannot see what you have built.
* Make sure to keep branch names consistently formatted
    * Also make sure to name the branch based on the functionality added or bugs being fixed as opposed to `merge-branch` or `junk`
* UI doesn't take up the full screen
* Should not be able to submit if names aren't filled out
* Some details missing on the UI as well as is not responsive yet
* Careful not to do inline functions in your HTML, put it in your JS
* Clean up commented out lines in the HTML
* Some areas where we can use more semantic HTML such as forms 
* Good work on the class names and being consistent with camel case
* Continue to work on organization of CSS and remember to alphabetize properties
* Continue to work on drying up styles so you don't have micro-manage everything
* Find areas where you can group classes together that share similar styles
* Clean up commented out lines in JavaScript
* Shouldn't need to query elements again if we already have queried them in global variables
* Organize event listeners together
* Make sure you tab the HTML in your JS
* See how you can refactor the evaluateGuesses so that you do not have repeated logic for player 1 and player 2
