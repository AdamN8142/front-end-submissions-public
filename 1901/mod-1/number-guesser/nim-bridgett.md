## Student: Nimrod Garcia, Bridgett Coyle 
## Evaluator: Khalid Williams 
## Notes/What To Work On:

* Github seems pretty good, dont forget to keep commit message in the active tense
* Range is updating on win
* Errors look good
* Can add and delete cards


* Comp recreation isn't exactly there, but the overall style looks good
* Repsonsive looks good in tablet
* The number guesser title cuts off before we get to 320px
    * As a result, this is just barely at an Advanced Beginner; we can't be as lenient with the next project

* HTML 
    * Could be more semantic
        * Do more reasearch on the different semantic tags available to you in HTML5 (main, )
    * Remove commented out lines; your tags, classes and ids should speakfor themselves 
    * You don't need multiuple form tags within one card-area (all of your range-setting inputs can be in one form)

* CSS
    * Good job organizing the rules and alphabetizing properties
    * Another media query for phone0szed screens would help with a few issues re: responsiveness

* JS
    * Too much commenting, your JS should be speaking for itself 
        * Go back and refactor this 
    * Check the formatting of your `if / else` statements for the correct indentation
    * Could better utlize helper functions in certain places (ex a function for handling the error in the `guess() ` function)
        * Shoudl avoid nested `if/else` statements 



### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.
=
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.


------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts markup according to the [turing html style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/html)

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
