## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good work on commits and branches and being descript as well as being consistent using kabob case for branch names
    * Continue to make more commits and branches (smaller commits, more branches)
* Buttons and inputs could be a bit bigger on desktop
* A little too much space where the guesses are
* I would avoid alerts for future projects but good error handling in general
* In mobile view a few things that could be spaced out better
    * A few breakpoints could come in earlier
    * Reset button isn't 100% centered in mobile view
* Good work with using semantic html
* Nice work being consistent with class names and using kabob case
* A few places where we could clean up a couple nested divs
    * HTML that is too nested can lock us in and make things more complicated with CSS and JS
* Good work with the organization of styles
    * Remember to alphabetize properties
* A few places where we could group classes together that share similar styles
* Organize all of your event listeners together
* Be consistent using function declarations as callback functions in your event listeners
* Move the event.preventDefault to the top
* Could refactor checkEmptyName and checkEmptyGuess functions into one
    * Many instances here where there are lots of repeated pieces of functionality could be refactored into smaller functions (including error functions)
* Good work using event delegation
