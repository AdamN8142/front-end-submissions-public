## Notes/What To Work On:
* Great work on number of commits and detailed commit messages
    * Be consistent using the imperative tense
* Also continue to create more branches but good work being consistent with your branch names
* A few details with spacing compared to comp
    - Missing alert icon with errors
* Mobile view things get a bit squished 
    * Could utilize space on the sides a bit more
    * Buttons aren't quite centered
* Good work with class names and being consistent with kabob case
* At times elements get a bit too nested but in general great work
* Good work using semantic tags and organizing HTML
* Sync up your labels with inputs using the `for` attribute
* Good organization of styles
    * Leave spaces between classes
* Remember to alphabetize properties in each class!
* Good work with organization of javascript with global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Functions get a bit chunky with all of the locally scoped variables
* Excellent refactoring functions so that they are dynamic based on arguments and parameters
* Great work with using event delegation and using forEach for deleting all cards
* Could potentially use a class to handle the game and user
* Good work keeping functions refactored and defending decisions made on how logic was handled
