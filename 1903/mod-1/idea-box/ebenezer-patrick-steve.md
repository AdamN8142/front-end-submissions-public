## Student: Ebenezer Ingalsbe & Patrick Goulding & Steve Rumizen
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- used trello to plan out what to work on
- paired at the beginning to get started and then broke things out into descrete tasks
- Ebenezer seems to be having some funky setup issue with github, and it's not tracking his commits consistently. Contribututions to the codebase seem uneven.
- really good attention to detail in the UI, looks really nice. a couple very small spots that could use a little bit of fiddling, overall really well done
- CSS has a couple spots that could use a refactor/adjustment of approach (hover states for the `filter by quality` on the side nav, for example)
- overall CSS is well executed and tidy
- HTML side nav structure could leverage more consistency in structure (using several different types of tags of parent elements of the sections within the side nav, could likely simplify and use that same tag for all)
- JS is clean and tidy
- codebase is thoughtfully written and tidy, a couple of places that would be good to refactor -- it's in a great spot to do a big refactor pass

### Functional Expectations


*  Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

### Comp Recreation

*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward


### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting, editing, & starring an idea
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and two arrays for your ideas and qualities
  *  There are no nested if else statements
