## Student: Kayla and Andreea
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- would meet every time they started a phase
- would divvy up remaining tasks for the day at the end of the night to see if they could get them wrapped up individually that evening
- used checklists to manage work and plan schedule
- CSS chaining selectors unnecessarily, err on the side of using fewer selectors and not chaining them
- several spots where multiple classes are used that are doing the same thing -- reduce number of classes so you don't have so many different classes that all have the same job (ie `.button` rather than `#update-range, #button-submit-guess, #button-reset-game, #button-clear-game`)
- media queries need a lot of refactoring. way too much duplicate, redundant code.
- _extremely_ long functions in JS
- refactor to DRY, single-responsibility functions
- overall, codebase really needs to be refactored

### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.
* __Proficient:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds to the above with HTML that incorporates semantic HTML elements and has a simple, clean HTML structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts CSS according to the [turing css style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/css)
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules and
  * Has 5 or less media queries for responsiveness


------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts JS according to the [turing js style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
