## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good work on number of commits and branches
    * Make sure commits use imperative tense
    * Make sure commit messages describe what is being changed
* Fun animation on the title
* See how you can utilize up all of the space on desktop view
* Would clear out guesses after submitting an answer
* Good attention to the user experience
* If the guess isn't valid, it shouldn't have an error if the name is there
* Make sure to utilize the full space on the screen, it is pretty tiny on desktop view.  
  * Forms are not centered on the left side like the comp 
  * Scores section gets a bit squished at around 600 px
* Remember to include a normalize/reset css file
* For now, please incorporate CSS animations by writing it out instead of using a library
* Really good work keeping the structure of the HTML clean
    * Potentially could see if we could clean up a few divs or use something like a section
    * Could reuse the button class for multiple buttons that are styled the same
    * Might experiment and see if you can do the same for the different challenger 1, challenger 2 elements that are styled the same as well
* Good organization of styles and alphabetizing the properties
    * Good use of grouping classes that share similar styles
* Good organization of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
    * Would clean up some of the comments, but I appreciate the detail to structure
* Noticed some elements have multiple event listeners, keep it to one if it's the same type of event you're listening for
* Careful of using inline styles 
* Good use of arguments and parameters in your function
* Experiment using a toggleClass for the error handling 
* See how you can refactor validateRange and validateFor AlphaNumberic into one function
    * Also see how you can refactor validateCh1Name and validateCh2Name, validateCh1Guess & validateCh2Guess, etc.

### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
