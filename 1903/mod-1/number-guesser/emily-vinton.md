## Student: Emily & Vinton
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- combo of pairing and divvying up tasks
- getting comfortable with git and github was hard
- overall codebase could use a tidying up pass
- HTML: using a lot of divs, spans, and strong tags rather than the appropriate simantic text tag
- HTML: lots of divs in general
- HTML: naming is generally thoughtful, think about how to make classes reusble and modular
- JS: really long functions
- JS: codebase needs to be refactored to make DRY, single responsibility functions
- UI: desktop view needs to be finished
- UI: mobile view is fairly tight, needs a little polish. Some spacing and alignment is wonky.
