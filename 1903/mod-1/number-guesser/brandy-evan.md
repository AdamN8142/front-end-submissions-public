## Student: Brandy & Evan
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- worked together, some pairing some divvying up of tasks
- no deleting cards, got a little stuck on targeting a card
- UI looks really good, a couple small margin tweaks but overall really well executed
- HTML has some issues: `header`, a `div`, and the script tag were all outside of the body.
- across the board: watch indentation, make sure nesting is correct. it makes your code easier to read
- *very* long functions, it'd be good to go in and refactor to clean them up and make sure they're single responsibility
- next project, work to have fewer global variables
- missing closing `{}` on both media queries

### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts markup according to the [turing html style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/html)
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds to the above with HTML that incorporates semantic HTML elements and has a simple, clean HTML structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules and
  * Has 5 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
