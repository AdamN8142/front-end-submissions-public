## Student: Ann Cerveny & Nathan Froehlich
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work on the README including the images, maybe include original comps as well!
* Good number of commits, could have more branches
    * Careful to make sure commits aren't too big and that the commit message describes what is being worked on
* Title could be centered vertically a little more
    * Can utilize space more on desktop view especially in the set range area
    * Can also be centered vertically a little more for the set range
* Careful of using alerts, not the best user experience
    * See if you can add a active state on the disabled buttons when they are functioning again
* Ipad view, quite a bit of height being added in between inputs in the form area
* On smaller views, try and make the cards the same width as the form 
* Couple of spacing things on the mobile view
    * More space between the update button and name width isn't the same as guess width
* Include a normalize/reset css file for cross browser compatibility
* Good work using labels inside of forms
* Make sure to keep challenger information and buttons in one form
* Potentially some ways we could reuse classes for multiple elements
    * Use ids for JS reasons to keep them unique, classes for styling
* Clean up commented out lines in HTML
* Might use something more semantic than spans in the HTML
* Good work with organization of styles and alphabetizing the properties
* Good start with grouping some elements together, still many places where we can find elements that share similar styles and group them up together
* Careful of percentages with margins 
* Would clean up comments on JavaScript file
* Careful of having multiple event listeners on the same element that are listening to the same type of event
    * Have one function call multiple functions
* Good organization of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Might see how we could refactor minError and maxError into one function
* Could also refactor p1Guess and p2Guess function into one
* Good work running functions inside of functions and handling multiple errors
* Could find some ways to refactor the disabled functionality


### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds to the above with HTML that incorporates semantic HTML elements and has a simple, clean HTML structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
