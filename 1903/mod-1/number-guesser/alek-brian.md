## Student: Alek Aker & Brian Byon
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good number of commits, be more descriptive with commit messages
    * Can also be more descriptive with branch names (css and javascript is very generic)
    * Include images on your README of the original comp, and what your app looks like
* Some buttons aren't disabled on load until after typing something in
* Reset button I would update the random number generated
    * Switch the functionality between clear and the reset button
* Could find more ways to make things more bulletproof 
    * Good error handling if my mix is higher than my max
    * But it doesn't cover if the challenger picks a number above the max or below
    * Can still submit even if not all of the inputs are filled out 
* Couple spacing things between elements as the screen gets squished
* Remember to include a normalize/reset css file
* Might make range elements labels for accessible and semantic reasons
* Would recommend using something more semantic than divs for each section (range, name and guess, and scores)
* Keep the button in the same form instead of a separate one
* See how you can use the same class for buttons and similar elements
  * Clean up commented out lines in the HTML
* Like the organization of styles from top to bottom, remember to alphabetize the properties
* Finding elements where you can group styles together and clean up similar styles
    * Some styles that are written out twice
* Align together on how to organize styles for javascript
    * Global variables, event listeners, function declarations
* Careful of adding multiple event listeners on the same button
* Good use of event delegation
* Some functions like the error functions or the tooHighTooLow functions could be refactored into one function
