## Notes/What To Work On:

- had some conflicting schedules, but worked it out
- would work together at turing
- would ping pong at home to make sure they were on the same page about what was being done
- overall, code base was tidy and well organized
- several instances of redundant functions that would be good to refactor to reduce duplication in the codebase
- UI needs some polish
- inconsistencies in units of measure used in CSS
- codebase is at a good place for a refactor
