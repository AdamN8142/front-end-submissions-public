### Comments:

* UnDry if its way more work like in the case of login
* data model should have very few if no redundencies
* Think about where helpers can be leveraged

## Rubric 

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal
  recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all
  components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async
  functionality.

### Redux Architecture

* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary      application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
* 2 - At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
