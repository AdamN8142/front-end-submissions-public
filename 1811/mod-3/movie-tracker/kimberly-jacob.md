### Evaluator: David Whitaker
### Students: Kim and Jake
### Comments:

* Missed some things in the spec. Maybe make a check list from the spec. (ie. logout missing)
* Keep file structure flat and simple
* Think about ui workflows, can enter button work, can the user get back to a certain page.
* Keep test runner clean. IF things are erroring, debug immediately. If failing, can skip and come back to.

## Rubric 

### Specification Adherence

* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing part of one or more of the 
  features outlined above. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design
  changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.
* 2 - Project is missing PropTypes, README updates, wireframes, or has more
  than 5 linter errors. Project team makes large infrequent git commits.
  Project shows a basic understanding of React.

### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all
  components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async
  functionality.

### Redux Architecture

* 2 - At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
* 2 - Application uses React Router, but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.
