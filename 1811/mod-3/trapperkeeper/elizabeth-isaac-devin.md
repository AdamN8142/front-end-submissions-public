## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all requirements above without error. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).

### Redux Architecture

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).
* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for undefined routes.

### Server side

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and all endpoints are tested (both happy and sad paths).
