### Project Professionalism

* 2 - Project is missing PropTypes, README updates, wireframes, or has more
  than 5 linter errors. Project team makes large infrequent git commits.
  Project shows a basic understanding of React.

### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps,  mapDispatchToProps), all
  components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async
  functionality.

### Redux Architecture

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the
  store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).

### Routing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for
  rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for
  undefined routes.
