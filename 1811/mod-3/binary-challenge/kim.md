### Project Professionalism

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, codebase has zero linter errors/warnings and
  readme contains screenshots of application. Project team uses a rebase
  workflow, taking advantage of github issues to track work. Project shows a
  complete mastery of React architecture.
* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are
  passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).

### Redux Architecture

* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary      application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for
  rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for
  undefined routes.
