## Student: Devin Kapla & Tim Miller
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Continue to work on smaller commits and making more branches.
  * Commits messages don't always entail everything you are working on.
* Great work on your documentation in the README
* In general great UI and UX
  * A few things with spacing as the screen gets smaller
  * A bit of a jump in width of buttons and inputs as screen jumps to mobile
  * Delete button isn't quite centered
* Stay away from inline functions in your HTML
* Careful of using ids and classes with the same name
* Great organization of styles from top to bottom and alphabetizing properties in each class
* Might work on using less media queries and see if you can only have 1
  * Keep an eye on spacing and tabbing things in correctly
* Great organization of JS and refactoring code
* Instead of tracking the quality and checking if it is swill, plausible, or genius keep them in an array and keep track of the index in the constructor function
* Experiment using bracket notation in your updateContent
* Good explanation of const/let.  Be consistent with using them instead of var
* Good understanding of arrow functions.  Remember arrow functions implicitly return a value (hence the reason why you don't need the keyword return)
* Careful when using ternaries.  If it's really long, I would recommend using if/else conditionals to make it more readable
