## Student: Duy, Rachael, Mason
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- can make a card without anything in the inputs
- can filter by quality but can't get back to all cards without refreshing the page
- quality persists on refresh
- UI could use a little bit of fine tuning, especially on small screens, but overall is well done and looks nice
- HTML and CSS could use a refactor for clarification and reduction of duplication
- HTML needs better naming of classes (`box2`, `box2b`, etc) -- it's unclear what various elements and containers are, which means someone unfamiliar with the codebase has to jump back and forth between the browsers, the code, and the comp to figure out what things are.
- CSS is impacted by HTML naming issues, it's hard to tell what's what
- CSS has duplication, needs a refactor
- JS is stylistically inconsistent, uses ES5, ES6, `let` and `var`, has arrow functions and traditional functions, etc. Decide as a team what patterns and approaches you are going to use and then be consistent.
- overall, project that is in a good place to be refactored.

### Functional Expectations

- advanced beginner score is due to ability to create a totally empty card (no title or body) and that after filtering by quality you can't return to see all cards of al qualities unless you refresh the page

* [ ]  Advanced Beginner - Application adds 'Changing the quality of an idea' and enables 'Filtering and Searching by Text' as defined in the spec

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* [ ]  Advanced Beginner - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* [ ]  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by using appropriate semantic elements and using `data-*` attributes for all data related things

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* [ ]  Advanced Beginner - Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* [ ]  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by correctly implementing a data model for the `Idea` class including all required methods
