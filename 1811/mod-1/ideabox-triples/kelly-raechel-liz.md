## Notes/What To Work On:

#### General:

* Idea qualitites are updating and sorting 
* Saving the card to local storage works and is persisting 
* Text filtering works in real time 
* Some transitions were a little jumpy, and the widths were inconsistent between filtering buttons, inputs and the search bar

#### HTML:
* Very semantic HTML!
* Good job using data atributes for the id on the cards you ammended
    * Think about other ways you could utilize them (ex storing info about the quality)
* The html is easy to follow, think about findhing some more standardized naming conventions you could use to improve clarity 

#### CSS:
* Good organization
* Dont forget to clean up the html tag and css rules 
    * ex having the search-input class and search id on line 15 in html 

#### JS:
* MAIN
    * All event listening uses named functions
    * Dont forget to dry up the the sorting functions (data attributes could be a help for that)
        * The 
    * Try and err away from using nested if statements if you can help it (ex: updateQuality definition, line 173 of main.js)

* IDEA
    * Be careful with your styling in the idea.js file (the tabs look 8 spaces long on github, turing standards are tab === 2 whitespaces)
    * Nice dry `updateContent()` method 

### Functional Expectations

* [ x ]  Proficient - Applications adds 'Filtering by Importance' and 'Recent Ideas' as outlined in the spec


------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* [ x ]  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward


------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* [ x ]  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* [ x ]  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

<!-- * [ ]  Novice - Crafts JS according to the [turing js style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
