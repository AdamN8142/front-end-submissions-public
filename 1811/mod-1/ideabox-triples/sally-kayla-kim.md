## Student: Sally, Kim, Kayla
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- can add cards with nothing in title or body
- hacky solution for show more/show less: use a fixed height on the container to hide cards, and have a scroll on the body content of cards to make all cards the same height
- quality is not persisting on refresh
- functionality is not totally flushed out
- UI is well executed and carefully done, could use a few tweaks around spacing and small details with alignment to make it really, really tight
- JS is clean and tidy, in a good place to refactor to reduce duplication
- overall, tidy, clean codebase. A few spots that could use some clean up, but nothing too major.

### Functional Expectations

- Advanced Beginner score reflects functionality not being totally complete with persisting quality and being able to create cards with empty inputs, even though filtering and search works.

* [ ]  Advanced Beginner - Application adds 'Changing the quality of an idea' and enables 'Filtering and Searching by Text' as defined in the spec

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation


* [ ]  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* [ ]  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* [ ]  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* [ ]  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  * [ ]  All functions are less than 10 lines
  * [ ]  There are less than 3 global variables
  * [ ]  There are no nested if else statements
