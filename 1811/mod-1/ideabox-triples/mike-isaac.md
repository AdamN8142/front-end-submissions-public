## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- can make a card without anything in the inputs
- UI is really nicely executed, could use some fine tuning but overall good attention to detail
- attempted to use BEM in HTML/CSS -- do some more research to really understand the thinking and planning behind this so you can use it more effectively
- nested if/else statements in JS, overall JS needs to be refactored
- overall, codebase needs a clean-up pass.
- the devil is in the details: push yourselves to do work that is at high level of quality that you are capable of.
