## Notes/What To Work On:
* Good start to descriptive branch names
    * Be consistent in descriptions and kabob-case
* Good descriptive commit messages and nice work creating lots of commits
    * Make sure messages match what the commit says
    * Try not to change HTML, CSS, and JS all in one commit (keep them separate)
* Continue to keep working on adding names to cards
* Continue to keep working on bugs with disabled buttons
    * Should be able to keep playing the game after resetting
* Still needs work for the responsive view
    * Add meta tag to your HTML for this as well
* Nice work with errors
* Try and format the styles without using br tags
* Got some nested divs (try keeping your HTML structure cleaner...it will help with styling)
* Stay away from inline functions in your HTML (keep it in your js file)
* Be consistent with kabob case for all styles
* Good descriptive class names
    * Do not need the `js` in id names
* Nice work with organizing by page flow (be consistent with that)
    * Organize properties of each style alphabetically
    * Work on media queries next time
* Careful, don't grab value in global variable (grab it in the function)
    * Shouldn't need to keep reassigning variables in callback functions
* Clean up commented out lines before evals in the future
* I'd move the disabled states into the html (as an attribute)
* Try organizing by global variables, event listeners, and then function declarations
* Use function declarations as your callback functions
* Think about how you could dry up the feedbackOne and feedbackTwo functions and combine them into one
* Practice more passing through arguments
