## Notes/What To Work On:
*General*
* On the whole, really nice job the project. A few little bugs aside, the functionality wsa really good. In the future, I'd work on paying closer attention to the spec regarding things like spacing, widths and text-sizes, and shy away from fixed widths. Good job!
* Keep commit messages consistant throughout the project 
* Make sure the error SVG is appearing for each error 
    * In general, make sure your errors are occuring in consistent ways. If there is an invalid input, we should get a similar error to the one for the invalid number range. Likewise, an invalid input shouldn't allow a new card to get submitted.
* Keep the button sizes consistant with the spec 
* Using label tags instead of p tags to keep things more semantic 
*HTML* 
* Awesome organization with the HTML -- very semantic 
*CSS*
* Great organization of the stylesheet
* Try and use fewer fixed sizes to prevent having to add as many media queries 
    * This will also help to clean up the CSS 
*JS*
* Good organzation!
* Try and use generalized versions of functions that are doing the same things (submitGuessPlayer functions) to DRY up the JS 
* Think about how to use parameters and interpolation to make your functions more dynamic 
* Nice manipulation of innerHMTL 


### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules and

  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
