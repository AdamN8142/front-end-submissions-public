## Student: Duy Vu and Kayla Lawson
## Evaluator: Khalid Williams 
## Notes/What To Work On:
*General*
* Keep commit messages consistantly specific, especially for next project 
* Also get into the habit of working with feature-branches 
* Work on being able to store information in variables as opposed to having functionality be dependent on filled-out input fields 
* In future projects work on staying more phase-based in terms of workflow
*HTML*
* Viewport meta tag for responsiveness 
* Work on cleaning up HTML to avoid having mutlitple sections inside of themselves
* Consolidate forms 
*CSS* 
* Remove commented out rules form the code before submtting 
* Add more media queries for smoother transitioning 
* Alphabetize properties in CSS rules 
* Keep labeling consistant across css file 
* Don't forget to follow the turing styles when it comes to apply a rule to multiple selectors (give each selector its own line)
*JS*
* Good organization on the JS (query selectors, event listeners, globals vars and functions)
* Use more global variable to DRY up things involving the min and max 
* Use inner HTML for making things like errors appear instead of hiding html elements
* The organization of your JS is good, but there are still a few bugs to catch (we shouldn't be able to win if there's an invalid guess from one of the players); be careful about these logical edge cases in future projects
    * Also, be careful about making your functions dependent on input values; these are getting cleared at multiple points of the game, so it's best to keep functions dependent on the variables that are storing the values from your inputs.

### Functional Expectations

* __Novice:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase one.


------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment, etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.


------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts markup according to the [turing html style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/html)


------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation


* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules and
  * Has 5 or less media queries for responsiveness


------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation


* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
