## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work on GitHub branch names
* Nice start on creating multiple commits
    * I would work on having clearer commit messages and keeping commits for HTML, CSS, and JS separate
* Remember to include the error svg icon when it errors out
* Nice work updating the card
    - Mess around with how you can add a new card each time a user wins
* Instead of refreshing the page, clear out the inputs and generate a new number without reloading
* Continue to work on media queries.  Handling spacing pretty well on several things
    * When it gets on smaller screens, there could be a bit more control
    * Work on responsiveness down to 320 px
* Look at bug with disabling the buttons after pressing the clear button
* Might use a span instead of the strong tag on the title
* Use a form for each part instead of a section (form for max min, form for names and guesses)
* Nice work using labels and inputs
* The name of Challenger1 div is a bit confusing
* Instead of having errors already in html and using position absolute, you could either use display none, or preferably, add them using JS
* Clear out commented out lines with HTML, CSS, and JS
* Stay away from inline functions
* Continue to work on organization of styles and alphabetize properties
* I might stay clear from using position relative and absolute and try to use flex to handle things
* Group elements with similar styles together or reuse one class
* Try combinging both number generators together
* Create organization between global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Make sure function declaration names match what the functionality does
* Find functions that have repeated functionality or conditionals that are doing similar things (and DRY it up into one function)
* Keep SRP on functions

### Functional Expectations

* __Novice:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase one.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds to the above with HTML that incorporates semantic HTML elements and has a simple, clean HTML structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules and
  * Has 5 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
