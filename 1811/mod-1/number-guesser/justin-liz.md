## Student: Liza Asbell and Justin Pyktel
## Evaluator: Khalid Williams 
## Notes/What To Work On:
*GENERAL*
* Work on using the html errors instead of alerts;
* Keep commit messages consustatntky specific 
* Small bug with reseting the text in the current guess section when reseting the game 
* Nice readme!
*HTML*
* Use fieldsets inside of the forms instead of the sections 
* In the future, don't nest headers
* Use `for` attributes when labeling inputs 
*CSS*
* Good organization of the CSS
* Try and find areas where rules can be partially DRYed up
*JS*
* Good organization of the JS
* For future projects, use innerHtml over using classes to hide or display hard-coded HTML 
* DRY up some repeated functions with parameters or smaller helper function that can remove some repeated code 
* Don't forget to use strict equals for comparisons 
* Keep function names specific to what the functionality actually is (ex player1Win)
* Think about what you could do to make the Reset / Clear buttons dissabled when the user manually clears the fields. What type of event could you attach a listener to for this?

### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.


------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.


------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds to the above with HTML that incorporates semantic HTML elements and has a simple, clean HTML structure.


------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation


* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements and:
  * Keeps functions DRY with a focus on SRP and can call functions within functions
  * There are no nested if/else statements
