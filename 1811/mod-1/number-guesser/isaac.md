## Notes/What To Work On:

- code base looks rushed and needs a refactor
- give yourself the time to do work at the level you are capable of -- this is not the standard of quality to set for yourself.
- if a project isn't very challenging for you, make sure what you deliver is absolutely water-tight. don't half ass things just because you already know how to do it. there is no reason to do sloppy work when you are capable of doing exceptional work.
