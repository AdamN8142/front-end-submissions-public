## Notes/What To Work On:
* Continue to keep working on making more branches and more descriptive names
    * Keep working on commits.  Need to create more.
    * Also pay attention to creating more detailed commit messages.
* Love the party animation when someone wins the game and using HTML canvas but.....
    * Make sure you understand how it works.  Anytime you take code from another person or site, you must be able to understand it.
* For the clear button, for the User, instead of clearing all inputs, you might want to make it clear only a few inputs 
    * This way a user can guess multiple times
* Work on functionality for reset button.  Maybe create a new random number?  etc.
* A few details in UI that need more work
    * The title needs less font weight
    * Make sure colors of each forms are correct
    * Center elements vertically on cards
* Nice work on deleting functionality
* Only need one span in h1 tag (for the title).  Target the h1 and give it a style, and then style the span differently.
* I would use labels for min/max ranges, and hook them up to the inputs.
* Stay away from using svg elements.  Use an img element and include the file path in the src.
* Use one form for all inputs and the update/submit button.
* Remember `box-sizing:border box`
* Keep `text-align: center` only one text elements
* Remember to alphabetize properties and really focus on organization of styles
* Nice work grouping some classes that share similar styles together
    * If you have more than 3 classes that are sharing similar styles, create one class that you can group together
* Try using function declarations as your callback functions instead of anonymous functions
* Be consistent with using function delcarations as callback functions instead of anonymous functions
* Check the styleguide for javascript.  Some things are tabbed in too much
* Try combining your playerOneGuessEval and playerTwoGuess functions into one
    - Several other functions that can be combined (including the error functions) if you pass an argument through
* Nice work of using event delegation (make sure you can explain how this works)
* Stay away from alerts, implement errors into the DOM
