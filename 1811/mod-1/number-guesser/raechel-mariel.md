## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work on creating multiple branches
    * Keep branches kabob case
    * Great, descriptive branch names!
* Good descriptive commit messages and having commits only focus on either HTML, CSS, or JS
* In desktop view, make sure it fills up the entire height
* I might keep the names in each time you submit for the user's experience
* Take a look at the bug where when you reset the game, it doesn't update the current range
* Keep working on mobile layout and paying attention to little details
    * Make sure winning card takes up full width
    * Make sure buttons stack on top of each other, etc.
* Nice work with using HTML structure 
    * A few nested divs here and there that could be cleaned up
    * Nice work with naming conventions and using BEMs
* Nice organization of styles and alphabetizing properties
    * Good use of grouping styles together
    * See how you can have a few less media queries (keeping transitions smooth without having to do too much micromanagement)
* Can dry up the conditional in the guessEval function
    * Break the conditional out into it's own function and pass the player element through as an argument;
* Nice descriptive names for each function declaration
* Clean up console.logs inside of there
* Careful of using inline styles for making it display visible
* Cheers to already starting to use array prototype methods
* Some instances where we could use a logical operator instead of an if/else

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
